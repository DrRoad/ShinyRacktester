## Introduction

It's well known that R is an effective tool to build equity trading model with. Many professional traders who can code in R build their own backtest framework to validate their own quantitative trading strategies.

Here I leveraged the commonly used _Quantmod_ for data acquisition, _dygraphs_ for the graphic and integrate with _Shiny_ to create my very own backtester. This project will be updated going forward. 

For your curiousity, I have hosted the current version at http://35.162.235.49:3838/ShinyRacktester/
